  <p>CS3281 and CS3282 (Officially known as <em>Thematic Systems Project I &amp; II</em> for legacy reasons, a more apt name would be <strong><em>Software Engineering in Large Projects</em></strong>) aim to build up your ability to work with large, complex
    systems that you will likely encounter in future as a Software Engineer, towards levels expected from engineers <strong>working at high-end software companies such as Facebook, Google, and Microsoft</strong>. Special emphasis will be placed on maintainability,
    efficiency, scalability, and reliability.</p>
  <p>Both modules involve <strong>working within the context of large OSS projects</strong> that are being developed and used in industry; students will not be building a new product from scratch.</p>
  <p>These two modules are to be taken concurrently and are offered in Semester 2 only. However, <mark>a small number of CS3282 places (without needing to take CS3281) are available for those who have already completed or will be completing their third year project module requirement using other project modules (e.g. CS3201&amp;2, CS3216+CS3217, similar).</mark></p>
  <p>CS3281&amp;2 provides an entry point to the <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/undergraduates/cs_vpn_prospective.html">von Neumann Program</a><span class="dimmed"> (the only other entry point is CS3217.)</span> If you perform well in this module,
    you will be invited to join the vNP.</p>
  <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong> : CS2103 or CS2103T</p>
  <h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
  <p><span class="dimmed">The two modules will run concurrently, but as two separate modules.</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong><a href="/website/admin/cs3281.html">CS3281</a></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>[30%]: Do a small contribution to a big OSS project</strong><br> Pick an established OSS project of your choice (recommended: pick from projects participating in the Google Summer of Code programme thus increasing your chances of getting
          into future GSoC programmes) and contribute to it in relatively small ways (e.g. bug fixing) while interacting with its developers and learning how the project is run.</li>
        <li><strong>[70%]: Build up an expertise area</strong><br> Pick a few expertise areas (of your choice) that can enhance your SE career prospects <span class="dimmed">-- a tool/technology e.g. Node.js, Cloud, an aspect e.g. Code quality, a language e.g. Kotlyn, Go -- and develop a demonstrable expertise in that area.</span></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

      <p><strong><a href="/website/admin/cs3282.html">CS3282</a></strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>[100%]: Do a major contribution to a medium size OSS project</strong><br> Students will be working in teams to add a major feature to one of the <strong><a href="https://github.com/nus-oss/main">NUS-OSS Projects</a></strong> (of your choice).
          Those who do well can stay with the project after the module and get promoted to higher positions (paid) of the project. In addition, those who score well for this module will get priority for internship positions for future SIP/ATAP rounds.</li>

  <h2 id="workload">Workload</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>As CS3281&amp;2 will be run and graded as two separate modules each generating a 4MC workload, i.e. 10+10= <strong>20 hours of workload per week</strong> in total.</li>
    <li>Lectures are compulsory to attend.
      <ul>
        <li>CS3281 lecture -- MON 1200-1400 in COM1-B103</li>
        <li>CS3282 lecture -- THU 1200-1400 in COM1-B103</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>In addition, you are required to attend a <mark><strong>compulsory full-day <em>Code Sprint</em></strong> (under CS3282) on the first Saturday of the semester (Jan 20th)</mark>.</li>
    <li>No tutorials. Ignore the tutorial timings given in IVLE/CORS.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
  <p>Students will be assessed on each module separately, based on their contributions to the project, and their skills/expertise gained. Both modules are 100% CA with no final exam.</p>
  <h2 id="enrollment">Enrollment</h2>
  <p>The class enrollment is <strong>capped at 20 students</strong> due to resource constraints.</p>
  <p>There is a soft lower bound for students’ <strong>CAP of 3.9</strong>; students may still apply for CS3281&amp;2 if they have a CAP below 3.9, but the candidate must demonstrate his/her strong passion for software engineering.</p>
  <p>Student selection is <strong>not based on CORS bidding</strong>. Instead, follow these instructions to apply for the module:</p>

  <h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Q: Can I apply to both CS3217 and CS3281&amp;2?<br> A: Yes. If you get places in both, you will be given time to decide which one to take.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Q: Can I take this module while doing ATAP/SIP?<br> A: No. <span class="dimmed">Reason: You need to be on-campus for lectures and project meetings.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Q: For CS3282, can I choose a project that is not one of the NUS-OSS projects?<br> A: No. <span class="dimmed">Reason: As 100% of your CS3282 module grade depends on your project work, you need to work in a project that is fully under our control.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Q: Can CEG students take this module?<br> A: Yes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Q: If selected for both CS3217 and CS3281&amp;2, can I take both? <br> A: Discouraged (but allowed). <span class="dimmed">Reason: all three modules have high workload.</span></p>
