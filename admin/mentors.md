# CS3281 Projects and Mentors

## CATCher

**Current focus:**
* Build up the sister app: WATcher
* Retire the desktop version.
* Find a way to make the tester's repo private during the PE (to prevent others copying bugs).
* Improve testing.
* Improve dev docs.
* Set up a proper user guide.
* [Less important] Add support for the _tutor moderation_ phase.

## MarkBind

**Current focus**:
* Make the following features _best-in-class_:
  * Tables
  * Code blocks
  * Diagrams
  * Icons
* Support deploying to more hosting platforms
* Improve built-in search (e.g., include full-text search) so that we don't have to rely on external services.
* Solve these hard problems:
  * Add support for generating multiple versions of a website %%e.g., documentation for different product versions%%.
  * Find a way to add pop-over explanations for statements in a code block.
  * Find a way to support PR previews (the way Netlify does it).
* Internal:
  * Improve the robustness of the architecture.
  * Improve developer documentation.

## RepoSense

**Current focus:**
* Improve performance of the report for large data sets e.g., [this report](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true).
* Ensure local report generation works for private repositories.
* Make it easy for someone to set up a 'moving window' report (e.g., show last 3 months) or a repo or multiple repos in an organization %%e.g., for a project manager/maintainer to keep an overview of the code changes to related repos%%.<br>
  Idea: Provide a ready-made repo they can fork and documentation on how to set it up with minimal effort required. Even better if there is a web page they can go to enter some data, click some buttons, which would set up the report automatically.
* Hard problems:
  * distinguish between <tooltip content="code touched only by one person">fully-owned</tooltip> and <tooltip content="code written by someone else but taken over by this author">partially-owned</tooltip> code. %%An FYP student has done some work on this aspect, but that work has stalled after the FYP ended.%%
