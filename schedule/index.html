            <p>While this is not a <em>graded</em> deliverable <span class="dimmed">(it used to be; we made it non-graded from this semester)</span>, you are encouraged to choose your CS3281&amp;2 work in a way that gives you an 'expertise' in a few areas.</p>
            <p><strong>Objective</strong>: Gain in-depth knowledge of a few specific areas so that you are considered an expert of those areas compared to your peers.</p>
            <p>Just one semester is certainly not enough to become an ‘expert’ of something. Consider this module just the initial step in the journey of becoming an expert. Our expectations are,</p>
            <ul>
              <li>By the end of the semester, you know your chosen expertise areas better than your peers to the extent that you can teach those peers interesting and useful things from those areas.</li>
              <li>Based on your current trajectory, assuming you continue to improve your knowledge in that area for 1-2 years after the module (for most of you this would coincide with your graduation), your knowledge in that area is among the top 5% of
                your cohort.</li>
              <li>The area must be strongly related to SE.</li>

                <p>Consider picking one from each of the three below.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>An <strong>Aspect</strong>: Various aspects of an SE project e.g. Testing, CI, Scalability, Requirements, Security, Performance, ...</li>
                  <li>A <strong>Language</strong>: e.g. Java, C#, Go, Python, Ruby, Kotlin, Elixir, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ...</li>
                  <li>A <strong>Domain</strong>: Any other technical topic relevant to SE that you want to claim as your interest/expert area e.g Search Engine Optimization, Regular Expressions</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Learn more about them yourself. While you do that, produce evidence of your knowledge. <span class="dimmed">E.g. blog posts, stackoverflow questions/answers</span></p>

<box type="warning">
<p>Give priority to applying the techniques covered in week 2 lecture even if you feel like they are cramping your natural presentation style or you can do better without them. Harmonizing your style with the new techniques can come later. In particular, <em>WIIFY</em>, <em>Key Points</em>, and <em>Impact</em> should be the driving forces of your presentation. Figure them out at the start of your preparations, not as an afterthought.
</p></box>
<p>Try to follow these steps in this sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Define the <em>intended impact</em> of the talk.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Try to choose an impact that has a <em>do</em> component (e.g., <code>get audience to switch to technology X</code>), not just <em>know</em> and <em>believe</em> components (e.g., <code>tell audience about X</code>). The <em>do</em> component will make the talk motivational and higher-impact; without it, the talk will be simply informational.</li>
<li>Frame the intended impact as a <em>call-to-action</em> (CtA).</li></ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find a <em>WIIFY</em></strong> i.e., a good reason for the audience to follow your CtA. The WIIFY can work better if it relates to this <em>specific</em> audience at a <em>concrete</em> level.
For example, explaining <code>how Foo technology can benefit SoC students right now</code> is better than making a general claim that <code>Foo is a useful technology</code>. Sometimes realizing that ‘there is a cool technology out there benefiting many others, but it is not accessible to me right now’ can be a turn off.<br>
If you cannot find a convincing WIIFY, reconsider the topic as there is a risk that the audience may not find the talk useful.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose <em>key points</em></strong> that help you achieve that impact. Be clear about your key points.</p>
<ul>
<li>We look for <strong>points, not topics</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>how to use X</code> is a topic while <code>X is easy to use</code> is a point</span>. In the past years, I found that some students still confused <em>points</em>          with <em>topics</em>. A point forms a sentence e.g., <code>The tool X is easy to use.</code> whereas a topic may not e.g., <code>Tool X usage</code>.</li>
          <li>Make sure your key points are aligned with the intended impact. If you key points are <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, you should be able to say &quot;<code>a</code>; <code>b</code>; <code>c</code>; <em>therefore</em>, <code>CtA</code>&quot;
            <span class="dimmed">e.g., &quot;<code>X is fast</code>; <code>X is free</code>; <code>X is getting popular</code>; <em>therefore</em>, <code>switch to X!</code>&quot;</span></li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Decide the talk <em>roadmap</em></strong> (aka the <em>agenda</em>, or the <em>promise</em>). They may be similar to key points but not necessarily the same. The roadmap can be topics (rather than points) and can be questions (rather
              than answers).
            </p>
            <div class="table-responsive">

                  <tr>

          <li>
            <p><strong>Find a PUNCH.</strong> This is hard, but give it your best shot. One good tactic is to find an extreme example of a pain point that can be solved by your topic <span class="dimmed">e.g, if your CtA is <code>switch to X</code>, you can start with an example that shows how bad something can be without X</span>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Design the slides</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>One common mistake is inadvertently including big holes in the talk, for example, forgetting to explain some concept that is vital to understanding the topic. Critically review your talk from the target audience point of view.<br></li>
              <li>Also mention how the topic fits into the big picture.<br>
                <span class="dimmed">e.g., if your talk is about X, the big picture can be like this:</span>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><span class="dimmed">There are two categories of tools for doing Bar which is an essential part in building apps. Category 1 tools work inside-out and Category 2 tools work outside-in. Tool X is the currently a hot tool in category 2 because it is faster and more secure than other popular tools in that category, namely Y and Z.</span></p>
                </blockquote>
              </li>
              <li>Ensure the last slide has the key points (not a big <code>Thank You</code> or <code>Q&amp;A</code>)</li>
              <li>Limit the content to what you can deliver in <strong>7 minutes</strong> (in rehearsals, aim to finish in 6 minutes; the actual talk is likely to take longer than the rehearsal). The remaining 3 minutes is for Q&amp;A.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Start the talk with a <em>PUNCH</em>, <em>WIIFY</em>, and the <em>Roadmap</em></strong>. <mark>Avoid the traditional <code>My name is A, my topic is B</code> type start.</mark></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>End the talk with key points and CtA.</strong> It is also good to reiterate WIIFY together with key points.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>Test your laptop connection to the projector in advance</strong>.</p>

                <li>Ensure every technical term used is either known to the audience or you define it explicitly. If you are not sure if the audience know the definition, <em>slip in</em> the definition casually to your explanations.</li>
                <li>Demo/describe your solution early to avoid setting expectations too high. <span class="dimmed">If you spend a lot of time explaning the problem or criticising competing solutions, audience expectations of your own solution might climb too high.</span></li>

              <p>Give priority to applying the techniques covered in week 2 lecture even if you feel like they are cramping your natural presentation style or you can do better without them. Harmonizing your style with the new techniques can come later.
                In particular,
                <em>WIIFY</em>, <em>Key Points</em>, and <em>Impact</em> should be the driving forces of your presentation. Figure them out at the start of your preparations, not as an afterthought.
              </p>
            </box>
            <p>Try to follow these steps in this sequence:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Define the <em>intended impact</em> of the talk.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Try to choose an impact that has a <em>do</em> component (e.g., <code>get audience to switch to technology X</code>), not just <em>know</em> and <em>believe</em> components (e.g., <code>tell audience about X</code>). The <em>do</em>                    component will make the talk motivational and higher-impact; without it, the talk will be simply informational.</li>
                  <li>Frame the intended impact as a <em>call-to-action</em> (CtA).</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Find a <em>WIIFY</em></strong> i.e., a good reason for the audience to follow your CtA. The WIIFY can work better if it relates to this <em>specific</em> audience at a <em>concrete</em> level. For example, explaining <code>how Foo technology can benefit SoC students right now</code>                  is better than making a general claim that <code>Foo is a useful technology</code>. Sometimes realizing that ‘there is a cool technology out there benefiting many others, but it is not accessible to me right now’ can be a turn off.<br>                  If you cannot find a convincing WIIFY, reconsider the topic as there is a risk that the audience may not find the talk useful.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Choose <em>key points</em></strong> that help you achieve that impact. Be clear about your key points.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>We look for <strong>points, not topics</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>how to use X</code> is a topic while <code>X is easy to use</code> is a point</span>. In the past years, I found that some students still confused <em>points</em>                    with <em>topics</em>. A point forms a sentence e.g., <code>The tool X is easy to use.</code> whereas a topic may not e.g., <code>Tool X usage</code>.</li>
                  <li>Make sure your key points are aligned with the intended impact. If you key points are <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, you should be able to say &quot;<code>a</code>; <code>b</code>; <code>c</code>; <em>therefore</em>,
                    <code>CtA</code>&quot;
                    <span class="dimmed">e.g., &quot;<code>X is fast</code>; <code>X is free</code>; <code>X is getting popular</code>; <em>therefore</em>, <code>switch to X!</code>&quot;</span></li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Decide the talk <em>roadmap</em></strong> (aka the <em>agenda</em>, or the <em>promise</em>). They may be similar to key points but not necessarily the same. The roadmap can be topics (rather than points) and can be questions (rather
                  than answers).</p>

                <p><strong>Find a PUNCH.</strong> This is hard, but give it your best shot. One good tactic is to find an extreme example of a pain point that can be solved by your topic <span class="dimmed">e.g, if your CtA is <code>switch to X</code>, you can start with an example that shows how bad something can be without X</span>.</p>

                  <li>One common mistake is inadvertently including big holes in the talk, for example, forgetting to explain some concept that is vital to understanding the topic. Critically review your talk from the target audience point of view.<br></li>
                  <li>Also mention how the topic fits into the big picture.<br>
                    <span class="dimmed">e.g., if your talk is about X, the big picture can be like this:</span>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p><span class="dimmed">There are two categories of tools for doing Bar which is an essential part in building apps. Category 1 tools work inside-out and Category 2 tools work outside-in.

                  <li>Limit the content to what you can deliver in <strong>7 minutes</strong> (in rehearsals, aim to finish in 6 minutes; the actual talk is likely to take longer than the rehearsal). The remaining 3 minutes is for Q&amp;A.</li>

              <li>
                <p><strong>End the talk with key points and CtA.</strong> It is also good to reiterate WIIFY together with key points.</p>

                and the printing date is likely to be earlier than presentation date. Please get my feedback for the poster before printing it. You can get a copy of the previous year poster from the whoever did the poster last year. As the poster is
                not graded, it is ok to reuse some of the stuff from the previous year poster, but best not to copy it wholesale.</li>

          <p><strong>Talk structure</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>🎯 The talk is well-structured and aims for high impact.
              <ol>
                <li>💡 Document all the important elements of PUMA given below (listed in the order one would define each when planning the talk structure) as an extra/hidden slide in the slide deck (for verification/grading purposes)
                  <ul>
                    <li>Intended impact:

                    <li>WIIFY</li>
                    <li>Key points</li>
                    <li>Call-to-action</li>
                    <li>Roadmap</li>

                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Slide design</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>🎯 No visual clutter
              <ol>
                <li>💡 Remove any conspicuous background graphics that do not add value</li>
                <li>💡 Avoid using
                  <tooltip content="done without good reason; uncalled for">gratuitous</tooltip> images that don't really add value</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>🎯 Visual slides
              <ol>
                <li>💡 Wherever you have bullet points (or paragraph text), look for another suitable structure such as a table, flow chart, map, graph, etc.</li>
                <li>💡 Use graphics instead of (or in addition to) text</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>🎯 Important elements of the talk are captured prominently in slides
              <ol>
                <li>💡 Ensure WIIFY, Roadmap, start/end of sections of the Roadmap, and each keypoint are captured as separate slides or as noticeable visual elements</li>
                <li>💡 Use words <code>Key point</code> in text so that they are hard to miss<br>
                  <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>KEY POINT: Java is verbose!</code></span></li>
                <li>💡 use a different (and more prominent) design for important slides and key elements<br>
                  <span class="dimmed">e.g., use a brighter background, bigger font size</span></li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>🎯 Last slide is used to good effect
              <ol>
                <li>💡 at least it should contain key points and the call-to-action</li>
                <li>💡 as the last slide should contain the essence of the talk, it is ok to be 'crowded'</li>
                <li>💡 you may want to include your contact details in the last slide too</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>🎯 Slides optimized to convey the point, and help your delivery
              <ol>
                <li>💡 Write down in slide notes the point(s) a slide is supposed to convey. Each slide should have at least a main point, and possibly some sub points. e.g.,
                  <pre><code class="hljs">Java is still the most popular language today.
* Java positions lead job vacancies.
* Highest percentage of devices support JVM.
* All fortune 500 companies use Java for their enterprise systems.
</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>💡 If possible, use the assertion-evidence format to bring out the main point. i.e., show the main point as the slide title.<br>
                  <span class="dimmed">e.g., the slide title can be <code>Java is still the most popular language today.</code> (i.e., the main point) instead of <code>Java popularity</code> (i.e., a phrase/topic)</span></li>
                <li>💡 For each sub point, ensure there is a corresponding click.<br>
                  <span class="dimmed">e.g., the slide should have at least three clicks so that you can use the click-look-recall technique as a prompt to talk about each of the three sub points.</span></li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>🎯 Minimum use of jargon
              <ol>
                <li>💡 Format jargon in a different way e.g., use a different font so that you remember to define them. Alternatively, put the definition on the slide.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>🎯 Meaningful animations
              <ol>
                <li>💡 Use meaningful slide transitions e.g., use a more drastic transition when moving from one major section to another.</li>
                <li>💡 When possible, gradually remove/introduce elements into a slide so that the audience can maintain context i.e., minimize drastic change of scenery.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>🎯 Start with a PUNCH (instead of traditional self-intro)
              <ol>
                <li>💡 Open with a brief greeting, and jump starlight into your PUNCH</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>🎯 WIIFY and Roadmap clearly communicated.
              <ol>
                <li>💡 Use clear 'marker' phrases to draw attention to these important elements of the talk. e.g., <code>&quot;I think this is a very important topic to you because ...&quot;</code> <code>&quot;In the next few minutes, I'm going to talk about (a)... (b)... and (c)&quot;</code></li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>🎯 Each key point is clearly made
              <ol>
                <li>💡 When the key slide comes up, use the marker phrase <code>&quot;So, the key point here is ...&quot;</code> to draw attention to it.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>🎯 Finish by reiterating key points, and call-to-action.
              <ol>
                <li>💡 Follow the call-to-action with a clear <code>&quot;Thank you!&quot;</code> and if applicable, <code>&quot;I'm ready for your questions&quot;</code> to indicate the end of your talk.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
